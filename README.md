# PDFDownloader :page_with_curl:

## Overview
The **PDFDownloader** project provides a convenient way to download PDFs from one or more Excel files containing links. It displays real-time progress via a Tkinter GUI and logs each download to an Excel “status file,” ensuring that any previously attempted downloads (successful or failed) aren’t retried. This tool is especially handy for large datasets, as it reads files in **chunks** to avoid overwhelming memory and allows multiple concurrent download threads for better performance.

## Features
- **Multi-File XLSX** Support: Pass in multiple Excel files; it will read chunks from each, combine them, shuffle, and download.
- **Concurrent Downloads**: Utilize multiple threads to speed up retrieval (configurable).
- **Fallback URL**: If the primary URL fails, the program tries a secondary link column.
- **Real-Time GUI**: Displays current download progress, status text, and success/failure counters.
- **Resumable**: A “status” Excel file ensures PDFs already attempted (successfully or otherwise) are skipped on subsequent runs.
- **Chunk-Based Reading**: Only loads a portion of the Excel file(s) at a time, making it scalable for large datasets.

---

## Requirements
- **Python 3.8+** (recommended)
- **pip** for installing packages

---

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RazorSDU/PDFDownloader.git
   cd PDFDownloader
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This installs pandas, requests, openpyxl, PyPDF2, and other needed libraries.

3. **Place or Prepare Excel Files**:

   - Put your `.xlsx` data sources in the `data/` folder.
   - Ensure the Excel columns match the expected fields (e.g., `Pdf_URL`, `BRnum`, and optionally `Report Html Address` for a fallback URL).

4. **Check/Set Output Folder**:

   - By default, PDFs will download to `data/PDFs/`. This folder is `.gitignored` to avoid committing large files.
   - You can change this location in the code if desired.

5. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   A Tkinter GUI will appear, and downloads will start in a background thread.  
   Press the window’s close button when you want to stop. The program will wait for active downloads to finish before exiting.

---

## Usage

### Automatic Download Start
Once you run `python main.py`, the code automatically begins reading your Excel file(s) and spawns download threads.

### Real-Time UI
- You’ll see a **Successes** counter and a **Failures** counter at the top.
- Each worker thread has a row below, showing a status label (`Idle`, `Attempting`, `Downloading`) and a progress bar.
- Progress bars update in near real-time.

### Stopping the Process
- Close the Tkinter window to stop.
- If any downloads are in progress, the main script will wait until they complete (or fail) before fully exiting.
- Rerun the program at any time. Already “Success” or “Failure” items won’t be attempted again.

---

## Configurable Variables

You can change these variables in the code (mostly located in `main.py` or in `downloader.py`):

- `xlsx_paths`:  
  Paths to the Excel file(s) you want to read.  
  Example:
  ```python
  ["data/GRI_2017_2020.xlsx", "data/Metadata2006_2016.xlsx"]
  ```

- `output_folder`:  
  The folder to store downloaded PDFs.  
  Default: `data/PDFs`

- `status_file`:  
  Path to the Excel file used to record each PDF’s outcome.  
  Default: `data/DownloadedStatus.xlsx`

- `dev_mode` (boolean):  
  If `True`, limits the number of successful downloads to `max_success` (useful for testing).

- `max_success` (integer):  
  Applies when `dev_mode` is `True`.  
  The downloader stops after this many successes.

- `max_concurrent_workers` (integer):  
  How many download threads you want to run in parallel.

- `chunk_size` (integer):  
  How many rows to read from each Excel at a time.  
  Larger values read more data at once but use more memory.

## How It Works

### Chunk-Based Reading
The program uses `read_xlsx_in_chunks(...)` to read slices of each Excel file.  
Each chunk is combined into a single DataFrame, shuffled, and then filtered to exclude rows already listed as success/failure in the status file.

### Concurrency & Status Updates
A `ThreadPoolExecutor` with `max_concurrent_workers` threads is used to download multiple PDFs in parallel.  
Progress updates (thread status, counters, progress percentage) are sent through a `Queue` to the GUI so it can refresh labels and progress bars.

### UI Components
- **Success/Failure Counters**: Show how many downloads have succeeded or failed so far.
- **Thread Rows**: Each worker thread row displays:
  - A status label (e.g., “Idle”, “Attempting Primary”, “Downloading …”)
  - A progress bar that updates if the server provides `Content-Length`.

### Status File Tracking
A dedicated Excel file (by default `data/DownloadedStatus.xlsx`) records each row’s outcome.  
Each row includes:
- `BRnum` (the unique identifier)
- `Status` (“Success” or “Failure”)
- `Info` (details on errors if any)

The code checks this file before attempting any new downloads, saving time by skipping items that have already been processed.

## ✨ What the App Does

### Core Functionality
* Reads thousands of report rows from multiple Excel workbooks **in chunks**.  
* Shuffles and filters rows to skip already-tried records.  
* Spawns up to *N* worker threads that download PDFs concurrently, first via a primary URL,
  then a fallback URL.  
* Writes a **status workbook** (`DownloadedStatus.xlsx`) recording Success / Failure & reason.

### Visuals & UX
* Real-time dashboard shows:  
  * Global success / failure counters.  
  * A row per worker with a status label and animated progress bar.  
* Dark UI with white text for high contrast.  
* Automatically closes when all work is done, or on user request.

### Engineering Features
* **Custom log levels** (`TRACE`, `FATAL`) and single-level file handlers
  for clean, searchable logs.  
* Low-memory, chunked Excel reading; safe for 100k+ rows.  
* Disk-space guard rail (< 5 MB free triggers abort).  
* Validates `%PDF-` signature **before** writing to disk, then parses with PyPDF2
  to catch corrupt files immediately.  
* Decoupled UI communication via a `Queue`, preventing cross-thread GUI calls.
